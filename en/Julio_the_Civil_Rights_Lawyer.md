# Julio, the Civil Rights Lawyer

\* Julio’s preferred gender pronoun is he/him/his.

Julio works at a civil rights NGO. Though he does not work directly with clients, he knows his personal habits protect his co-workers and, thus, the clients as well. Julio works very hard to ensure his **security hygiene** is quite good to responsibly care for his organization.

What needs protecting?

- Legal information
- Financial information, both donors and employees
- Contact lists of partners and clients
- Integrity and trust the organization has built
- Private documents, like client statements and advocacy strategies

Julio is vulnerable during his frequent travels due to unprotected wi-fi connections, border checks, and multiple hotels he stays in. He has an open and helpful nature, which may make him trust others too quickly. His organization is widely known for its work, and he is their public face, often being contacted by strangers for assistance or advice. 

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:

- Julio **keeps software up-to-date**.
- He has a **password manager** where he generates **unique, strong passwords**. To secure his password manager, he created a passphrase that is both strong and easy to remember using the **Diceware method**.
- When on shared or open wi-fi (like in a cafe), Julio uses a trusted **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** to encrypt his initial connection to the internet.
- When reading email, Julio **uses caution in opening unexpected links or attachments**, unless he has verified the senders’ identity by calling or messaging them.
- When crossing country borders, Julio turns off his computer to ensure his **full-disk encryption** is active to prevent unauthorized access to his information.
- He remembers what is posted outside of work can impact the NGO's work as well. He is mindful when posting, to ensure what he publishes on his personal accounts cannot be used to personally target him or the NGO he works for (he is wary of posting locations, images from private events, addresses, etc.).
