# Jaha, the Student
\* Jaha’s preferred gender pronoun is she/her/hers.

Jaha is a student in her final year of college. She is interested in being part of a movement that accepts a fly-free lifestyle, a taboo in froggy culture. Many resources on such topics are blocked by the university, and she’d face stigma and suspicion if it was a known interest of hers. Jaha needs to **stay anonymous and keep her browsing private while online**.

What needs protecting?
- Personal privacy
- Personal control over identity
- Access to free flow of information
- Separation of online personas

Jaha does not want her family, or many of her social circle, to know her interests yet. She wants the freedom to explore this possible new side of herself without feeling watched and judged by others. Maya has created a separate self online and does not want to risk public exposure until she is ready, but she still wants to access some material the university has censored.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities:
- Jaha employs **circumvention and anonymity tools** to obscure her identity and avoid censorship.
- She uses **privacy enhancing browser extensions** to avoid ad-tracking which may reveal some of her interests.
- Jaha regularly **clears out her chat histories** to avoid malicious access to previous conversation logs.
- **Anonymous chat** lets Jaha connect with others like her.
- She maintains **separate online personas** to divide her personal life from her academic life, taking special care to avoid being identifiable.
- Jaha employs **mindful postin**g to ensure what she publishes online cannot be traced back to her (wary of posting locations, specific dates, home addresses, etc.).
